# ðŸš€ DCA Investment Simulator

This is a simple Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) simulator for crypto assets.  

ðŸ”Ž Overview

This project is a Streamlit web application that simulates the Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) investment strategy for cryptocurrencies (and optionally stocks).
Users can input a crypto ticker (e.g., BTC-USD, ETH-USD), define how much they want to invest periodically, and choose the frequency (daily, weekly, monthly). The app then calculates how many units were bought over time, the total value, and compares the results with a lump-sum investment.

DCA is a popular strategy where investors consistently invest a fixed amount regardless of the asset price, which helps reduce the risk of market volatility.
